            <p>The long-time hit from Mojang Studios continues to pull big numbers. 
                The open-world sandbox game was released in 2011 and, due to the fact it’s a 
                constantly evolving entity, it remains popular today. As of 2021, 
                Minecraft had sold over 235M copies and over 700M registered users.</p>

            <p>Fortnite has been one of the most popular games online since its release in 2017. Regardless of whether players are locked in battle royales, trying to survive, or fighting in tower-defense mode, the point is they’re playing.

                With over 62K positive votes on Ranker in 2022 and 80M monthly active users, Fortnite remains one of the most popular games right now.</p>

            <img src="./assets/pubg img.jpg" alt="PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds">

            <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the most popular games right now and it probably will be for a long time.

                It has over 1.2B users (that's right, over 1 billion), and even though the number of peak concurrent users is significantly less than 1.2 billion (it’s just under 700M in 2022), it’s still a hit thanks to its ongoing updates and drops.</p>
